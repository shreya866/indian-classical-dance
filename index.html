    <p1>Excavations, inscriptions, chronicles, genealogies of kings and artists, literary sources, sculpture and painting of different periods 
        provide extensive evidence on dance in India.</p1>
        <br></br>


    <p1>Contemporary classical dance forms have evolved out of the musical play or sangeet-nataka performed from the 12th century to the 19th century. 
        The Indian classical dances have two basic aspects - Tandava (movement & rhythm) and Lasya (grace, bhava & rasa). 
        The three main components are -
    
        <ul>
        <li>Natya (the dramatic element of the dance i.e. the imitation of characters)</li>
        <li>Nritta (the dance movements in their basic form)</li>
        <li>Nritya (expressional component i.e. mudras or gestures)</li>
        </ul>
    
    The nine rasas are - Love, Heroism, Pathos, Humour, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Wonder and Peace. 
        The Natya Shastra written by Bharat Muni is the most prominent source for the Indian aestheticians for establishing the characteristics of the dances.</p1>

            <h2>Bharatanatyam</h2>
            <p>The Abhinaya Darpana by Nandikesvara is one of the main sources of textual material, for the study of the technique and grammar of body 
                movement in Bharatnatyam Dance.
             Bharatnatyam dance is known to be ekaharya, where one dancer takes on many roles in a single performance. 
             The dance involves transitional movements of leg, hip and arm. Expressive eye movements and hand gestures are used to convey emotions. 
             The accompanying orchestra consists of a vocalist, a mridangam player, violinist or veena player, a flautist and a cymbal player. 
             The person who conducts the dance recitation is the Nattuvanar. 
             In its usual form the dance is generally broken into seven main parts: Alarippu, Jatiswaran, Shabda, Varna, Pada, Thillana and Sloka. 
             Bharatnatyam poses are depicted on the gopurams of the Chidambaram temple (Tamil Nadu). E. 
             Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale had played a significant role in helping the dance regain its lost popularity and position.</p>

            <h2>Kathak</h2>
            <p>The word Kathak has been derived from the word Katha which means a story.
                It was primarily a temple or village performance wherein the dancers narrated stories from ancient scriptures.
                Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement.
                The legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers.
                Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak was performed in the court, where it acquired its present features and developed into a form of 
                dance with a distinctive style.
                Under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into a major art form. </p>

        <h2>Kuchipudi</h2>
        <p>Kuchipudi is the regional classical dance of Andhra Pradesh. It got its name from an ancient city-Kuchelapuram.
            Originally, Kuchipudi was performed by men only. Women were given permission to perform this art quite later.
            Kuchipudi classical dance form is a methodical dance art to offer prayers and representations of the life of Krishna. 
            It symbolizes the inseparable bond between the god and the devotee.
            Kuchipudi dance includes more turns rather than steps.
            The fan of the dress of the Kuchipudi dance is way bigger than that of the Bharatnatyam dance.
            Raja Reddy, Radha Reddy, Yamini Reddy, Kaushalya Reddy, and Bhavana Reddy are all famous Kuchipudi dancers of India.</p></div>

        <div class="txt">
        <h2>Kathakali</h2>
        <p>The art of Kathakali developed from a variety of socio-religious theatre forms that were practised in ancient South India.
            A few ritual performance arts from Kerala- Chakiarkoothu, Koodiyattam, Krishnanattam, and Ramanattam- directly influenced the look and style of Kathakali.
            Kathakali's classical dance form has also been influenced by Kerala's traditional martial arts.
            Kerala temple structures and paintings that are of the 16th century at the Mattancherry temple both have elements of Kathakali.
            It involves Abhinay, which is made up of 4 parts Angika, Acharya, Vijika, Satvika, and Natya, to make up a complete art form.
            The makeup code of Kathakali determines the characters in the deeds and categorizes them as being sattva, rajas, and tamas, which are all parts of the 
            personality theory that comes from the traditional School of Hindu Philosophy-Samkhya.</p></div>

        <h2>Odissi</h2>
        <p>The stories of Lord Vishnu's past life and lyrics from Jaideva's Geeta Govindam serve as the main topics for the performances of the Odissi dance form.
            Odissi dance is a gentle and coming dance having soothing lyrics that share mudras and facial gestures with Bharatnatyam.
            Odissi dance is referred to as mobile scripture and includes Darbhanga and Chowk positions in which the body is bent at the knees, neck, and torso.
            The top performers of this classical dance of India are Sonal Mansingh and Kelu Charan Mohapatra.</p></div>

        <h2>Manipuri</h2>
        <p>The beginning of the Manipuri dance form dates back to antiquity, even before history was first written down of it.
            The earliest type of dance in Manipur is called Lai Haraoba, and it serves as the foundation for all others.
            In the state of Manipur Lai Haraoba is a celebration that is still celebrated. The literal meaning of Lai Haraoba is the revelry of god.
            The priests, sometimes called 'maibas', are the main performers of Manipuri dance.
            The prime subjects depicted by Manipuri dance are of it is playing the love tales between Krishna and Radha, along with other themes as per performance.
            There are three different types of Raslila performed in Manipuri dance. 
            
            The major instruments used in Manipuri dance are the barrel drum, cymbal, and other string instruments.
            Guru Vipin Sinha, Darshan Jhaveri, and Nirmala Mehta are some famous Manipuri dancers.</p></div>

        <h2>Mohiniyattam</h2>
        <p>The dance of Mohiniyattam is based on the Lasya style of Natya Shastra.
            It includes more feminine facial expressions and delicate motions. The motions are smooth and gliding and do not move in quick rhythmic movements.
            The hand motions and facial expressions are given more attention in this classical dance form.
            There are elements that have been adapted from thiruvathirakali and nangiar koothu, which are two additional dance styles from Kerala.
            The Mohiniyattam dance form is performed only by women traditionally.
            Some analysts estimate that will that form is 700 years old.
            The 16th-century Indian legal treaty Vyavaharamala, written by Mazhamagalam Narayanan Namboodiri, has one of the oldest references to Mohiniyattam.
            Sunanda Nair, Jayaprabha Menon, Pallavi Krishnan, Gopika Verma, and Vijayalakshmi are some of the best-known Mohiniyattam dancers in India.</p></div>

        <h2>Sattriya</h2>
        <p>Sattriya is an Assamese dance form that was established by the great reformer Mahapurusha Sankaradeva in the 15th century. He initiated this dance 
            form as a potent means of spreading the Vaishnava religion.
            Later, this Indian classical dance form developed and broadened into a separate dance style.
            Sattriya was properly given its name due to its religious nature and connection to Sattras.
            Sattriya dance form was invented by Shankar Deva, whose dancing style was used with local traditional dance and his unique perspective along with 
            diverse components from many treatises.</p></div>
